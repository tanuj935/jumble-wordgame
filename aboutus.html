<h1><b>ABOUT US</h1><br>
<p>Jumble is a word puzzle with a clue, a drawing illustrating the clue, and a set of <br>
words, each of which is “jumbled” by scrambling its letters. A solver reconstructs the <br>
words, and then arranges letters at marked positions in the words to spell the answer <br>
phrase to the clue. The clue and illustration always provide hints about the answer <br>
phrase. There are many variations of puzzles from the Jumble brand including jumble,<br> 
Jumble for Kids, Jumble Crosswords, TV Jumble, Jumble BrainBusters, Jumble BrainBusters<br>
 Junior, Hollywood Jumble, Jumble Jong, Jumble Word Vault, Jumping Jumble, Jumble Solitaire,<br>
 and Jumble Word Web.<br>
Jumble was created in 1954 by Martin Naydel, who was better known for his<br>
 work on comic books. It originally appeared under the title "Scramble" Henri Arnold and Bob <br>
Lee took over the feature in 1962 and continued it for at least 30 years. As of 2013, Jumble was<br>
 being maintained by David L. Hoyt and Jeff Knurek. Jumble is one of the most valuable properties <br>
of its distributor, US company Tribune Content Agency, which owns the JUMBLE trademarks and copyrights.<br>
 Daily and Sunday Jumble puzzles appear in over 600 newspapers in the United States and internationally.<br>
